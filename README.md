# Bingo with Python

Created when started with Python. Saw a bingo game whilst on holiday and decided to try and recreate it. So far it meets all my initial requirements.

## Features

* Choose randomly 1 out of three game modes.
* Tracks and displays the 5 previous numbers called.
* Numbers grouping into their corresponding letter, e.g. B has numbers 1 - 15.
* Once a row has been exhausted the letter background colour turns Magenta.
* Counts the number of numbers called.
